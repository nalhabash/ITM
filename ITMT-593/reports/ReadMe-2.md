# MeetUp report - Breaking Into Your Building - A Hacker's Guide to Unauthorized Physical Access
From April 19th, 2018.

This Meetup highlights the security flaws that a hacker can see and take advantage in the physical world to have access to restricted locations. 
It was presented by Brent White, a Senior Security consultant at NTT Security and a regular speaker for cybersecurity-related events.

Nowadays modern facilities such as offices or exhibition centers heavily rely on Information systems for their security (allowing specific persons to access specific locations, protecting data, Intellectual Property,...).
Brent White showed how easy it can actually be to bypass those security controls, loot information or data, and leave. It is possible to do so with tools that are accessible to anyone, publicly (like a USB drive, a fake NFC badge,...).

He illustrated this with several examples of "MacGiver-style missions" he actually performed in several situations to test some companies' security system, and it works pretty well. Not only did he use some hacking skills, but he also relied heavily on preparation to trick and persuade security agents that his story was real every time (he really was an IT guy, or something similar).

I found this presentation very interesting, as it showed how security, as tight and modern it may look, can often be flawed on a technological or human level.
It also made me think of popular titles like Mr Robot (a TV show on hacking, society and Big Brother) or the Watch Dogs video game Franchise. They also rely on hacking to get unauthorized access to physical areas.
