# NewSpace Chicago MeetUp report - Navigating Legal Challenges within the Commercial Space Industry
From March 6th, 2018.

The Meet Up's purpose was to highlight the legal challenges that come with the creation and operation of a company that wishes to enter the commercial space industry.  
The speaker was Charles Mudd, a lawyer and founder of a law firm that represents such companies.
This industry has been booming in the recent years (with SpaceX as the most well-known example). But his sector have specific legal problematics that other transportation and travel industries don't.

Several levels of legislation apply to this industry:
+ Traditional Law
+ Intellectual Property
+ Regulatory Regime
+ Nuanced Law
+ Space Law

The American administration that play a major role in the legal regulation of Commercial Space companies are the Department of State and the Department of Commerce. In the DOS, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations plays a major role. We might not think of weapons at first when it comes to space travel, but the materials and ressources necessary for that can often be used for defense too (chemical substances and propelling power).  
Companies must be very cautious about those details, as violations can be very specific and costly. This is due to the danger and fear of exporting technology illegally.  

Even if a company respects the ITAR weapons list, it still needs to check if their employees are American or from authorized countries, to prevent sharing with non-allied countries. Companies should also get a license from EAR (the Export Administration Regulation), which can offer deals if the company uses technology from or in the US (at least 10% of it).  


I found this MeetUp very interesting, although I expected it to be more technology oriented. When I am thinking of building a company or making a start up, I rarely think of all the legal obstacles that come with it, and this meetup helped me change the way I think about tech companies. I am more aware of legal challenges regarding international law, or intellectual property.
