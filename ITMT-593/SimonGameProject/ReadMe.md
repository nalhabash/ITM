# Simon Game Project

The Simon Game is a well-known memory game where a device displays sequences of elements (lights, digits, or other), that the player must then repeat in the same order without mistakes with the given input.

I have done this project using an Arduino UNO board for the Embedded Systems class.

First, here's a picture of the completed project :

So I chose to use a joystick module for the user input, as it was in the kit I purchased. I also like it since it makes me think of arcade and video games, which is related to this game project.  
The project follows all of the requirements, such as using 4 LEDs, a LCD screen and a piezo buzzer for audio output (and an analog input device)

Here's a fritzing sketch of my project:
