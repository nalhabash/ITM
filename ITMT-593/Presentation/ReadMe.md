# Smart Technology Presentation

## Topic: Levels of autonomy among autonomous cars.


I chose to talk about autonomous cars, since it is a topic that triggers my interest a lot (all topics related to AI actually). 
I did not do a presentation though, but simply talked about the topic in class for a short time, without pictures. I thought the presentation had to be brief, so my work might seem little compared to other students who did the effort to do a detailled powerpoint persentation.

Anyway, my topic was focused on the different levels of autonomy self-driving cars actually had, giving examples of current market leaders who play an important role in the technology's development. I also shared my thoughts and opinions on the market and its future evolution.

Some of the references I used for my research (mostly french websites, if you can translate them do so):
