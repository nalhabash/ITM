# IT Background

I am specialized in Information Technology and Electrical and Computer Engineering.
My interest for new technologies dates from my early childhood. From videogames, to computer assembling, website design, or even video editing, I have tried learning all kinds of things. Always on my own.

# Where I am from

Born and raised in Rennes, a city in Brittany, Western France. Planet Earth.

# Something about me..

I used to spend unreasonable amounts of time playing video games in my early days, but these times are almost over.
I always try to do new things, taste new foods.. I enjoy travelling and visiting new places or meeting new people ! 
I probably have some qualities, but they are hidden behind the huge default I have: I am always late for work !
When I am there, I do work with certain passion though !
